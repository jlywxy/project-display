qrun 
    The qrun utility simplifies the use of Questa tools to compile, optimize
    and simulate a design by taking all input files and options, and then
    automatically executing the correct tool and command-line arguments for
    each file.
    
    The qrun command has these critical features
    
    * Simplifies the building of a mixed-language design by choosing the
    appropriate tool and arguments to compile for each file.
    
    * Keeps track of timestamps to only re-compile files that have changed.
    
    * Maintains a history of previously executed commands. This allows you to
    browse a list commands, and re-run a line without having to specify all the
    previous arguments.
    
    * Provides a way to output a shell script for a build.
    
    The qrun command supports the following simulation languages.
    SystemVerilog/Verilog
    VHDL
    SystemC, C/C++ (DPI/PLI/FLI) source, and compiled object files
    
    Try the following to get help on specific options or categories: 

    qrun -help all            : List all categories and options
    qrun -help category       : List all categories
    qrun -help <option>       : Help on an option
    qrun -help <command-line> : Help on all options in a command-line
    qrun -help <category>     : List all options in a category
